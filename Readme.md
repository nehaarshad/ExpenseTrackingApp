#Balancio - Expense Tracker App 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project, Balancio - a #ReactNative app built using Expo CLI 📱💻 and utilizes Firebase as its backend🔥.
This expense tracker app empowers users to manage their finances effectively:

✨ Add and manage multiple wallets
✨ Record transactions for each wallet
✨ View detailed analytics for informed financial decisions
✨ Home view displays all transactions, remaining balance, total income, and expenses

#KeyFeatures:
📊 Transaction management (add, edit, delete)
💳 Wallet management (add, edit, delete)
📈 Analytics feature for insights into spending habits
👤 Profile image handling for personalization
🔄 Automatic updates for wallet deletion (transactions and balance)

This project allowed me to dive deeper into React Native and manage hooks like:

🔹 useContext
🔹 useEffect
🔹 useState

This Project is designed to be responsive 😍 and works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices, providing a consistent user experience across platforms 📱💻.

Building Balancio was a challenging 🥴 yet rewarding experience. I learned to:

💡 Manage complex state logic
💻 Optimize app performance
📝 Implement robust error handling
